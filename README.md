### Guidelines

When contributing a new workshop, please make sure to include the following:

- A README.md file that contains the information for the workshop.
  - This should include a brief introduction to the workshop, a table of contents, and sections for each topic covered.
  - If the workshop includes any code snippets, please use the appropriate syntax highlighting for the language being used.
  - If the workshop includes any exercises, please include the exercise prompt and any relevant code snippets at the end of the README.md file.
- Directories for any additional resources, such as code snippets or example files.
  - For example, if the README.md file references an image or code snippet, please include the image or code snippet in a separate directory within the workshop's directory. i.e. `bash-scripting/images/` or `bash-scripting/code/`.
  - If the workshop includes any exercises, please include the exercise prompt and any relevant code snippets in a separate directory within the workshop's directory. i.e. `bash-scripting/exercises/`.
- A brief description of the workshop to include in the Workshop List table in the README.md file for the Ram Hacks Workshop Directory.
  - Please, feel free to include your name and a link to your personal website or portfolio in the table as well. We want to give credit where credit is due!
